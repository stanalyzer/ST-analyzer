Description: 
        Pyhull is a Python wrapper to Qhull (http://www.qhull.org/) for the
        computation of the convex hull, Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram.
        It is written as a Python C extension, with both high-level and low-level
        interfaces to qhull.
        
        Pyhull has been tested to scale to 10,000 7D points for convex hull
        calculations (results in ~ 10 seconds), and 10,000 6D points for Delaunay
        triangulations and Voronoi tesselations (~ 100 seconds). Higher number of
        points and higher dimensions should be accessible depending on your machine,
        but may take a significant amount of time.
